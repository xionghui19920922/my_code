The fork ports the package from coffeescript to ES6, and makes a number of modifications to make the 'open files' pane look similar to Sublime Text:\n\n* The pane appears as part of the tree-view, sitting above it. It resizes automatically to show all open files, and it shares the same scroller as the tree-view.\n* The 'open files' panel is collapseable when clicking on the label. An option in the settings tab makes it possible to make the panel uncollapseable.\n* The 'open files' and 'folders' sections of the panel are clearly and elegantly labeled.\n* The file list can be ordered alphabetically using multiple (cascading) criteria: filename (base), extension (ext) and directory (dir). The order of these criteria can be indicated as a (comma-separated) string in the settings. Default is: base, ext, dir. This is the same functionality that can be found in the [tab-smart-sort](https://atom.io/packages/tab-smart-sort) package.\n* The cross to close a file only appears when the mouse hovers over the entry (while the 'edited' marker is always visible).\n* NEW in 0.6.0: In order to prevent the fast sliding down of the tree view when a file is added, there is a delay before the file appears in the 'open files' panel. The delay is configurable in the package's settings (default is 1000 ms, i.e., 1 second).\n* NEW in 0.6.0: Files added and removed from the 'open files' panel are animated. The animation has a default duration of 300 ms, but this is configurable in the package's settings (default is 300 ms).\n* NEW in 0.7.0: When several panels are open, the title for the 'open files' panels now includes PANEL #, with the number showing the order in which the panels were opened. When panels are closed, the numbers of the panels are re-calculated so that they reflect the panels present in the workspace\n* NEW in 0.8.0: The icons mirror those of the tabs for all Atom views in both the `file-icons` and the `seti-icons` packages\n* NEW in 0.8.0: The files in the 'open files' panel are automatically re-sorted when there is a file name change or a new file is saved for the first time. The icons also change automatically\n\n## TODO\n\n* Make the files in the 'open files' panel draggable, and keep the tab order in sync with the 'open files' order.\n* Configuration. Ideas and suggestions for further configuration options are welcome.\n\n[apm-image]: https://img.shields.io/apm/v/myTreeView.svg?style=flat-square\n[apm-url]: https://atom.io/packages/myTreeView\n\n[apmi-image]: https://img.shields.io/apm/dm/myTreeView.svg?style=flat-square\n[apmi-url]: https://atom.io/packages/myTreeView\n",
